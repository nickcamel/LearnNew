Create new objects with attributes

We have a main-loop which is interrupted by user by pressing 'ctrl-c'

Now, enter a name for the object (press enter)

Then, enter an attribute for the object (press enter)
OR
leave the attribute blank (press enter). This will print the object


If you want to add an attribute to an object, 
First, type in the name of the already existing object (press enter)
Then, type in an additional attribute (press enter)



First time a name is entered, the object will be created and you have the chance of adding an attribute.
The second time an object name is enter, you have the chance of adding addtional attribute.


Example
car

pants
are long

pants
are blue

car
cheap
(now car have both attribute "fast" and "cheap")
